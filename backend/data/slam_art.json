    "description": "This scene depicts a bustling affluent neighborhood. Fine carriages, African Americans transporting wares, and well-dressed passersby proceed along the thoroughfare and wide sidewalks. The sense of a community where all members agree to get along, central to genre painting, is conveyed here in the friendly exchanges between residents. The fine Italianate home, with its gently sloping roof and stately iron fence, has never been identified. It is likely that Henry Lewis created it from a group of sketches he made of houses while working in St. Louis as a scenery painter for the St. Louis Theatre in 1848. Lewis completed the painting in Dusseldorf, Germany, a haven for American genre artists who produced many of their most popular works there. Once finished, the works of art were shipped back to the United States for exhibition and sale.",

The artist loved flowers and described gathering each day “a beautiful bouquet for the breakfast table.” One might imagine him clipping the white corn lilies, red and bluish-purple heliotropes, and strawberries as they all ripened and bloomed in early June. Delicate heliotrope blossoms were especially popular with 19th-century gardeners, who compared their sweet fragrance to the aroma of cherry pie. Heade painted this small still life early in his career, during an enormously productive six-month period in which he sought to raise funds for an extensive trip to South America. Over the next 40 years, he painted nearly 150 still lifes, including a wide range of native and tropical flowers.",

Best known for his dramatic paintings of the West, Albert Bierstadt also made more intimate sketches that capture with equal power the expansive grandeur of the Rocky Mountains. Bierstadt painted Surveyor's Wagon in the Rockies in 1859 while part of a government survey party bound for the Rocky Mountains. Artists like Bierstadt wanted their largely Eastern clientele to know they had actually seen the landscape they painted. Travel through the area was nearly impossible, however, without the provisions and expertise provided by military or government expeditions.",

This painting would have adorned the walls of an upper-class dining room and affirmed social and economic status. Still life was considered an appropriate subject for female artists, who generally were excluded from more lucrative painting subjects and formal training in the United States in the 19th century. Hannah Brown Skeele worked in St. Louis in the 1860s. She was considered an amateur artist, though her works won considerable acclaim.",

This began to shift during the Roman Republic (509–27 BCE), when there was a marked increase in portraits of children, particularly boys. This funerary portrait is in good company with the marble sculpture of a boy’s head nearby, which was also likely a funerary portrait.",

Whether maintaining a small altar at home for the worship of a particular deity, or presenting gifts called votives, at sanctuaries or graves, many of the objects that survive from antiquity served a ritual function. Terracotta objects, such as this perfume bottle, reflect the most common medium for votive and dedicatory items because of its availability and affordability.",

Wonder Woman announces a kungka party in America. Combining powerful women with Indigenous Australian cultures, Whiskey playfully celebrates sisterhood and invites everyone to have fun.",

The design for painting his face included an upturned crescent on his chin, here visible as a dark, tapering line. Made for trade during the reservation era, this drum demonstrates how Plains men adapted ancestral pictorial conventions to earn income under foreign economic and social contexts.",

Gloria Petyarr is a leading Aboriginal artist, member of a major artmaking family in Utopia, and a founding member of the Utopia Women’s Batik Group. Around 1990, Utopia artists began to paint parts of abandoned cars strewn across the local environment. In this remote location, towing defunct cars to scrapyards is often unprofitable. In 1989, the automobile company BMW commissioned the artist Michael Jagamara Nelson, from the Central Desert community of Papunya, to paint an art car as part of a prestigious series that also involved American and British artists Andy Warhol, Jenny Holzer, and David Hockney. Based on this project, advisors encouraged Utopia artists to paint car parts.",

This knowledge and material altered ancient practices of southwestern jewelry making, which previously focused on shell and stones such as turquoise. Diné peoples wear silver jewelry as symbols of wealth. By the 1890s, smiths also began to make works for the souvenir market in the Southwest.",

The female figures pose using the society’s hand gesture, left fist over right with thumbs concealed.

Rather, his adornments show that he is a sambhogakaya Buddha who reveals the splendor and glory of enlightenment. In his left hand, Vajrasattva holds a bell that symbolizes clear insight into the true nature of reality. Vajrasattva’s right hand bears a vajra that symbolizes the compassionate application of that insight to help other beings skillfully. In Mahayana Buddhism, it is only by combining intellectual insight with compassionate activity that true enlightenment is achieved.",

In the related piece, the shepherd feeds grapes to his beloved. Shepherds and shepherdesses in amorous couplings appear frequently in the painting, sculpture, and decorative arts of the 18th century. Mme Du Pompadour, the favorite mistress of Louis XV, owned examples of this pair.",

The victorious god cut off the satyr’s skin in punishment for his pride. The surprised look on Marsyas’ face, in shadow, contrasts vividly with the calm and illuminated demeanor of the god who coolly slices the creature’s flesh. It is no accident that the earthbound satyr stands before a tree, symbolic of the woodland, while the god is silhouetted against the sky. Bartolomeo Manfredi may have been a student of the Italian artist Caravaggio, from whom he adapted the close-up format of the picture and the keen attention to tactile surface qualities evident in Marsyas’ fur loincloth.",

Van der Weyden was renowned for his expressive, naturalistic figures, especially his iconic images of the Virgin and Child. Following a prevalent compositional type, the Virgin seems to present her son as he sits atop a gold brocade pillow resting on a stone parapet. The child holds a butterfly between his two fingers, a reference to death and rebirth, and thus a reminder of Christ’s coming sacrifice.",

The brilliant highlights and careful shading of her skin and clothing contrast with the dark background to create lifelike three-dimensionality. Gerrit van Honthorst developed these popular stylistic elements in Rome in the early 17th century. He used them effectively to enhance the woman’s physical presence.",

Half-masks with a veil and Tricorn hats were worn by priviledged women and men during the months of Carnival. The artist has captured the delicate transparency of the seated woman's veil that covers but does not conceal the red flower on her bodice.",

The dragon on this tile has enormous claws on his back feet, while the multiple lines for his front feet and tail suggest vigorous movement.",

In Damascus, tiles of extraordinary quality were made in a style similar to those produced at Iznik, in modern Turkey, for the court in Istanbul. The main difference is that the Damascus potters focused on blue, green and sometimes purple on a brilliant white background, while the Iznik potters incorporated the color red. A floral composition such as this one could be extended indefinitely to cover as much surface as needed. Large quantities of Damascus tiles were made to decorate the porches and interior walls of the many buildings constructed in Syria during this prosperous era.",

Three fellow soldiers observe in the background; the tallest may be a self-portrait of André Derain who painted this work during a year of military service. The artist takes a humorous approach to his subject, presenting the dance as an awkward social ritual. This early picture is notable for its areas of bold, flat color, anticipating Derain’s experiments with Fauvism.",

Cooper’s pose is based on the stance of Charles I of England in a 1633 portrait by Dutch painter Daniel Mytens I in the Museum’s collection. Artist Kehinde Wiley uses the long‑standing practice of portraiture to address absences and erasures of black individuals in European and American art history. In his paintings, Wiley replaces white figures depicted in historical artworks with images of contemporary African Americans, Africans, and people of the African diaspora. In 2017, Wiley visited neighborhoods in north St. Louis and Ferguson, Missouri, where he selected Cooper and other individuals to pose for his paintings.",

What appears to be a spontaneous composition was laboriously worked by the artist to achieve complexity and depth. The painting’s title translates as 'Mount of Olives' and suggests a reference not only to a natural setting but also to the biblical mountain of the New Testament. However, Richter’s approach to abstraction is ironic and detached in contrast to the spiritual resonances of the American Abstract Expressionist tradition. His title remains purposely opaque and may even allude to the street name of the home of the grandparents of artist Iza Genzken, his former wife.",

During this period the artist turned away from the direct depiction of nature in favor of a more abstract approach and came to believe in the suggestive power of color. In this painting of the winter landscape, however, Kandinsky restricted his palette to subtle whites, browns, pinks, and blues. The choice of subject matter and the way the paint is applied create a tension between stasis and movement in the canvas. In the foliage of the tree in the right foreground, Kandinsky applied oil paint in layers, giving the appearance of ephemeral watercolor washes. White paint mixes with color to create muted tones, such as the dirty brown smoke emitted from the small locomotive chugging across the frozen valley.",
